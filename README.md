# 2016-Presidential-Election-Analysis
This Repository deals with data from the United States presidential election from 2016, and explores relationships from this data with visualization and statistical analysis.

# Examples of the Map
Eventually, I would like the map to be loaded onto a webpage as a widget.

# Data
Thank you to Tony McGovern for supplying the data set from the election. His data can be found here: https://github.com/tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16. 

# Goals
This project has been for me to primarily learn how to use shapefiles to create interactive maps in R that are supplied with data. Inspiration and help was taken from https://www.computerworld.com/article/3038270/data-analytics/create-maps-in-r-in-10-fairly-easy-steps.html. 

I will eventually do some more anaylsis using population metrics once I catch a break from school!
